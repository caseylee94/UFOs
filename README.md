# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a dynamic website using Javascript and Bootstrap to allow visitors to filter through UFO sightings based on certain criteria. The client (Dana), first wanted a webpage that would allow the visitors to filter by date of UFO sightings. Once created, Dana asked for the site to be further developed and to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for the city, state, country, and shape at the same time. This will greatly increase the user experience by enabling them to discover specific instances that they are curious about. Since the webpage was already built, the html code for the webpage and the javascript file only had to be refactored.
